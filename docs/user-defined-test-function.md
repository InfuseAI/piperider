# User defined test function

In addition to builtins assertion function, PipeRider also supports adding customized assertion function. User defined
test functions are put at a regular Python Module.

## How does it work?

There is a customized assertion in our assertion configuration `customized_assertions.assert_nothing_table_example`.

```yaml

data: # Table Name
  # Test Cases for Table
  tests:
    - name: assert_nothing_table_example
      assert:
        param1: value1
```

That means

1. You have put a python module `customized_assertions.py` into PipeRider plugin search path.
2. There must be an assertion class named `assert_nothing_table_example` in the `customized_assertions.py`

### Plugin Search Path

PipeRider will find plugins in this order:

* ./piperider/plugins
* environment variable `PIPERIDER_PLUGINS`

For example, the user defined test functions could be at:

* the default search path: `./piperider/plugins/customized_assertions.py`
* somewhere of `PIPERIDER_PLUGINS`

```bash
export PIPERIDER_PLUGINS=/foo/bar
/foo/bar/customized_assertions.py
```

## Implementation customized assertion

After you `init` the PipeRider, you can find two examples at the `./piperider/plugins/customized_assertions.py`.

* assert_nothing_table_example
* assert_nothing_column_example

The customized assertion must implementation `BaseAssertionType` like this:

```python
from piperider_cli.assertion_engine.assertion import AssertionContext, AssertionResult, ValidationResult
from piperider_cli.assertion_engine.types import BaseAssertionType, register_assertion_function


class AssertNothingTableExample(BaseAssertionType):
  def name(self):
    return 'assert_nothing_table_example'

  def execute(self, context: AssertionContext, table: str, column: str, metrics: dict) -> AssertionResult:
    table_metrics = metrics.get('tables', {}).get(table)
    if table_metrics is None:
      # cannot find the table in the metrics
      return context.result.fail()

    # 1. Get the metric for the current table
    # We support two metrics for table level metrics: ['row_count', 'col_count']
    row_count = table_metrics.get('row_count')
    # col_count = table_metrics.get('col_count')

    # 2. Get expectation from assert input
    expected = context.asserts.get('something', [])

    # 3. Implement your logic to check requirement between expectation and actual value in the metrics

    # 4. send result

    # 4.1 mark it as failed result
    # return context.result.fail('what I saw in the metric')

    # 4.2 mark it as success result
    # return context.result.success('what I saw in the metric')

    return context.result.success('what I saw in the metric')

  def validate(self, context: AssertionContext) -> ValidationResult:
    result = ValidationResult(context)
    result.errors.append(('ERROR', 'explain to users why this broken'))
    return result


# register new assertions
register_assertion_function(AssertNothingTableExample)
```

* name method provides the function name that will be used in the assertion yaml.
* execute method is your implementation to give the result of the assertion function.
* validate method could help you check `assert` parameters before PipeRider is profiling.

#### execute details

When the assertion has been called, PipeRider will put all arguments to `execute` method for you:

* context: helper object for assembling result entry to the report.
* table: the table name you are asserting.
* column: the column name you are checking, but it could be null when the assertion is put on the table level assertion.
* metrics: the profiling output could be asserted.

### Assertion process

You might follow this steps to implement the assertion process:

1. Get metric by table and column (The fact you see from the metric)
2. Get assert settings from context (The expectation written in the assertion yaml)
3. Check metric and assert and decide the result `pass` or `failed`

We will explain each steps with concrete examples in the `customized_assertions.py`

#### Get metric

`metrics` is a python dict object, we could look up it with `table` and `column`.

Table level metric:

```python
table_metrics = metrics.get('tables', {}).get(table)
if table_metrics is None:
  # cannot find the table in the metrics
  return context.result.fail()
```

Column level metric:

```python
column_metrics = metrics.get('tables', {}).get(table, {}).get('columns', {}).get(column)
if column_metrics is None:
  # cannot find the column in the metrics
  return context.result.fail()
```

#### Get assert

`assert` is the expectation put on the configuration file, like this:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: customized_assertions.assert_nothing_table_example
    assert:
      param1: value1
```

In the function, you can get the value of `param1` in this way:

```python
expected = context.asserts.get('param1', '')
```

#### Return result

You can conclude a result to the report. Before that, you need an actual value in the result. Don't forget to set up it:

```python
context.result.actual = 'something I saw from the metrics'
```

Finally, you could return the result:

```python
return context.result.success() 
```

```python
return context.result.fail()
```

## Profiling Data

You might want to know what kinds of data you have in the `metric` dict? There is a `.profiler.json` in the output path
of the `run` command. Open it and check the content:

```
ls -alh $(MY_PROJECT)/.piperider/outputs/$(DATASOURCE)-$(TIMESTAMP)
total 48
drwxr-xr-x   4 piperider  staff   128B  6  1 09:35 .
drwxr-xr-x  26 piperider  staff   832B  6  1 09:35 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 piperider  staff   6.2K  6  1 09:35 .profiler.json
-rw-r--r--   1 piperider  staff    15K  6  1 09:35 data.json
```

#### Validation

Validation is used when `diagnose` or before `profiling` to verify the `assert` are well-defined in the assertion file.

If everything was fine, the `validate` could return an ValidationResult without errors

```python
  def validate(self, context: AssertionContext) -> ValidationResult:
    result = ValidationResult(context)
    return result
```

If you have found something wrong, tried to add the reason to the result object:

```python
    def validate(self, context: AssertionContext) -> ValidationResult:
        result = ValidationResult(context)
        result.errors.append(('ERROR', 'explain to users why this broken'))
        return result
```
